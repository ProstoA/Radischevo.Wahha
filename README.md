Wahha
======
Wahha is a universal framework written in C# targeting .NET Framework 3.5. 
It has been developed by me since 2007, when I first tried to extract functions and helpers commonly used in my projects.

My future plan is to completely rewrite all the framework code from scratch, remove features that conflict with .NET 4.5, implement DI support, CQRS for data access, add tests and much more.
By 2013, the development is suspended.
